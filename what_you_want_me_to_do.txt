Paroles de «What You Want Me To Do?» de The Heavy

I've been loved
I don't feel clever
One mans weakness
Is another mans pleasure
I got no feelings
I got no heart
Can't make no sense out of this
But I got to somehow

What you want me to do
What you want me to say
How you need me to be?
I can be that way
What you want me to do
What you want me to say
How you need me to be?
'Cause I can do that...

When I feel tender
Like I've been lost
Put myself together
'Cause paid my cost to be the boss
I ain't sleepin'
I ain't slept
I see what you see here
But in this life
You give what you get

What you want me to do
What you want me to say
How you need me to be?
I can be that way
What you want me to do
What you want me to say
How you need me to be?
'Cause I can do that...
Oh, I can do that
Said I can be that
Oh, I can be that way
I can be that

Wow, yeah

What you want me to do
What you want me to say
How you need me to be?
I can be that way
What you want me to do
What you want me to say
How you need me to be?
'Cause I can do that...
Oh, I can do that
Said I can be that
Oh, I can be that way
